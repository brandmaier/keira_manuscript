## Creating exams from a Word template

The `exams` package generates exams from a set of items that are specified with one file per item either as Markdown or as LaTeX. For users unfamiliar with either format, `keira` offers a specification of exams as a Microsoft Word file.

## Generating reports

```{r echo=FALSE}
keira::grade_report(nops_eval_file = "nops_eval.csv",
                    path_to_scans = "png/",
                    outfolder = "reports/")
```

The `grade_report` function has various parameters to adapt the style of the graded report sheet. Table X provides an overview of all parameters.

| Parameter         | Type | Description |
|-------------------|------|-------------|
| show_points       | B    | xx          |
| show_total_points | B    | xx          |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |
|                   |      |             |

Item Difficulty

A major advantage of machine-readable exams is the opportunity for a quantitative analysis of the exams. For example, it seems good practice to compute item difficulty both for informing future item selection as well as potentially identifying coding errors or other problems with individual items. To generate an item difficulty plot, use the following command:

```{r echo=FALSE}
keira::plot_item_difficulty()
```

## Styling reports

The report style in `keira` is customizable. The parameter `style` is a list of functions that draw marks for hits, misses, false alarms and correct rejections. By default, a hit is drawn with green rectangle, a miss with a red cross, a false alaram with a red box and correct rejections are not marked at all.

## Data analysis

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.
